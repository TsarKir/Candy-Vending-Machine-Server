# Business Logic

## Input Validation
- Validate `candyCount` to ensure it is a positive integer.
- Validate `candyType` to ensure it matches one of the following valid types: "CE", "AA", "NT", "DE", or "YR".

## Price Calculation
- Calculate the total price based on the `candyType` and `candyCount`.
- If `money` provided is less than the total price, respond with HTTP 402 and an error message indicating how much more is needed.
- If money is sufficient, respond with HTTP 201, including a thank you message and the change to be returned.

## Example Requests

### Valid Purchase Request
```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"money": 20, "candyType": "AA", "candyCount": 1}' http://127.0.0.1:3333/buy_candy 
# Response: {"change":5,"thanks":"Thank you!"}
```

## Insufficient Funds Request
```bash
curl -XPOST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"money": 46, "candyType": "YR", "candyCount": 2}' http://127.0.0.1:3333/buy_candy 
# Response: {"error":"You need {amount} more money!"}
```

# Security Requirements

## Mutual TLS Authentication

### Certificate Generation
- Use Minica to generate two certificate/key pairsâ€”one for the server and one for the client. Ensure that a CA file (`minica.pem`) is created.

### Server Configuration
- Update the server to support TLS using secure URLs and accept command-line parameters for CA file, key file, and cert file.

### Client Configuration
- Implement a test client that supports the following flags:
  - `-k`: Two-letter abbreviation for the candy type.
  - `-c`: Count of candy to buy.
  - `-m`: Amount of money provided.

### Example Client Command
```bash
./candy-client -k AA -c 2 -m 50 
# Expected Output: Thank you! Your change is 20.
```
